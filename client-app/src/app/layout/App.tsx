/**
 * @component App
 * @description The App component serves as the root component for the React application.
 * It fetches activities from an API, maintains the activities state, and renders the NavBar and ActivityDashboard components.
 * It also utilizes the MobX store for additional state management.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered App component.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The App component uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch activities from the API when the component mounts.
 * It includes the NavBar and ActivityDashboard components for displaying the navigation bar and list of activities, respectively.
 * The component also accesses the `activityStore` from the MobX store context to manage the activities.
 * If the activities are still loading, it displays a LoadingComponent.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import React from 'react';
 * import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
 * import App from './App';
 *
 * ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
 *   <React.StrictMode>
 *     <App />
 *   </React.StrictMode>,
 * );
 * ```
